    A wrapper for `collection.aggregate` that is tailored specifically for the
    collection that's tagged `adsorption`. This differs from
    `get_adsorption_docs` in two ways:  1) it does not filter out "bad
    adsorptions" and 2) it takes projections based on initial configurations,
    not final, post-relaxation cofigurations. Thus this function finds
    everything that we've attempted.

    Args:
        adsorbate       A string indicating the adsorbate that you want to find
                        the attempted calculations for.
        vasp_settings   [optional] An OrderedDict containing the default energy
                        cutoff, VASP pseudo-potential version number
                        (pp_version), and exchange-correlational settings. This
                        should be obtained (and modified, if necessary) from
                        `gaspy.defaults.adslab_settings()['vasp']`. If `None`,
                        then pulls default settings.
    Returns:
        cleaned_docs    A list of dictionaries whose key/value pairings are the
                        ones given by `gaspy.defaults.adsorption_projection`.
                        Each document represents a calculation that we have
                        tried.

def get_low_coverage_docs(adsorbate, model_tag=defaults.model()):
    '''
    Each surface has many possible adsorption sites. The site with the most
    negative adsorption energy (i.e., the strongest-binding site) will tend to
    be the dominating site at low adsorbate coverages. This function will find
    and return the low-coverage binding site for each surface. The adsorption
    energies used to find these sites are taken from DFT calculations whenever
    possible; when not possible, the energies are taken from model predictions.

    If a document came from the adsorption collection, then it will inherit the
    structure it got from `get_adsorption_docs`. If a document came from the
    catalog collection, then it will inherit the structure it got from
    `get_catalog_docs`. For ease-of-use, we also copied the predicted energies
    within each catalog document into the 'energy' key of the document (just
    like the adsorption documents have) so that all documents have energies in
    one consistent location.

    Args:
        adsorbate   A string indicating the adsorbate you want to get the
                    low-coverage sites for, e.g., 'CO' or 'H'
